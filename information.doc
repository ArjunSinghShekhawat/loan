1.Data vizualizations - :
                        I am perform data vizualizations in notebook so that 
                        1.When the age, experiance , and current job year, current house year are all minimum then this person are highly risky.
                        2.Maximum persons are single.
2.model performance -:
                        1. I am used all machine learning algoritham but the best accuracy of the algorithm is Random Forest Classifier.
                        2. The accuracy of the model is  0.8773677248677249 and precision 0 and recall 8.154460144536728.

3.understand main deciding factors associated with risk -:
                                                        The main fector of the risk  age, experiance , and current job year, current house year will be minimum.
